# Forecast Icons

aWhere's [Forecast API](http://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/forecast) includes a couple of properties that summarize the forecasted conditions using a three-digit code and human-friendly text. The three digit code is a simple way to understand the predicted cloud cover, rain, and wind. 

For example, the code 321 (using the "basic" codes) means it's very cloudy (3), lightly raining (2), but very little wind (1).  You can learn more about these codes and what they mean in the [API documentation](http://developer.awhere.com/api/reference/forecast#conditions-codes-and-text).

To make using this code a little bit easier, we've created a set of icons that correspond to these conditions codes. Each image in the collection is named after each of the possible three-digit codes, so you can simply tack on ".png" to the code to get the image. 

## Available Icons 

We've included a suite of icons either in basic black-and-white outlines, and a second set with some additional coloring. 

We've also included the master sheet of all Icons as an Adobe Illustrator file, so you can use these as a starting point to make them unique for your application (or export new sizes and formats). 

**Note:** Today we only have icons for the "basic" codes, but icons for the "standard" codes will come soon.
