# Contributing Icons to aWhere Repositories

We welcome contributions to our code samples, libraries, SDKs, widgets, sample applications, image resources, and other code resources hosted through GitHub. Please feel free to fork, edit, add, and then send us your changes through a pull request. Someone from our team will review your submission, work with you to make any adjustments, and then merge it into our public repo. 

Contributed resources will become part of the main repository offered by aWhere, Inc., and governed by the license designated in the GitHub repository (usually the MIT License). You may only contribute resources (images, code, etc) that you yourself have created. By contributing resources or edits, you are agreeing to release any claim of copyright, royalty, or exclusivity for the use of the code. You also grant aWhere a universal and irrevocable right to publish, edit, use the resources in our products (free or commercial), publish the resources on our Developers Portal (developer.awhere.com), and other reasonable purposes. You're also allowing for other developers, both independent and commercial, to use your contributed code in their projects. 

Contributed resources will be attributed to you with your name and/or github username, plus website or email address if desired. Edits to your contributed resources may bring additional attributions, but your name will not be removed. Attributions may be made in an ancillary file provided with the repo. Image resources should not include watermarks. 

We cannot guarantee that all contributed code will be merged into the repository, and we may choose to unpublish or delete any code or repository at any time. 

Please send questions to api@awhere.com.
